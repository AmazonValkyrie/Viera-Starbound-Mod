Their lifespan is known to be three times that of Humes, with physical aging slowing down upon reaching adulthood. Viera possess natural leporine physical features, and are taller and longer limbed than the average Hume. They possess exceptional senses, especially in hearing. This makes them ideal at protecting their beloved tree canopies from the outside world. Guided by a life force entity they only refer to as “The Wood,” the Viera are predominantly a matriarchal society, following the “Green Word” of the Wood Herself. The Viera can commune with the Wood around them and now weave a tale with Her guidance across the stars.\n[img] https://i.imgur.com/NwLPpIS.png [/img]\nThis diminutive race is easily recognized by their small stature, distinctive pom-poms atop their heads and the small, bat-like wings on their backs. Moogles are highly skilled machinists, renowned for their craftsmanship and ingenuity. In addition to their expertise in mechanical devices, they possess an innate understanding of magicite technology, deftly harnessing its power to enhance machinery and create innovative tools. Their mastery over this rare and potent resource has made them invaluable engineers and artificers, blending magic and mechanics in ways few others can match. Moogles also boast a variety of unique professions, many tailored to their exceptional talents.\n[img] https://i.imgur.com/ua1oaiK.png [/img]\nCovered from head to toe in resilient scales, the Bangaa are a hardy reptilian race known for their long, angular faces and powerful limbs. They possess remarkable longevity, often living twice as long as the average Hume. Despite their physical differences, their intelligence and social customs are comparable to those of Humes. With their formidable strength, fierce tempers, and deep-rooted love of battle, Bangaa naturally excel on the front lines, thriving in roles that demand raw power and endurance. Their imposing stature and sheer resilience make them well-suited for jobs reliant on brute force. While their rough vocal cords make traditional spellcasting difficult, some Bangaa have mastered magic through unique incantations tailored to their own language, proving that even arcane arts are not beyond their grasp.\n[img] https://i.imgur.com/iatENwT.png [/img]\n[list]\n[*] Tooltips for Magicite Aura (Enviro-Protection) Back Items as well as other items\n[*] Moogle Tier Armor Image Assets\n[*] Moogle Mech Bodies (Using Viera currently)\n[*] Environmental Chocobo for challenging environments\n[*] Additions and fine tuning to Majestic Forest planets\n[*] Bangaa Species with basic setup\n[/list]\n\n[img] https://i.imgur.com/QvjshHH.png [/img]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3450252672]Frackin' Universe Compatibility Patch[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3450254966]Enhanced Storage Compatibility Patch[/url]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/ZZzx2zi.png [/img]\n[list]\n[*] [h2]My character’s armor animation doesn’t fit, what’s going on?[/h2]\nThe races within this mod have custom bodies and animations that deviate from the single body the base game uses for every race. This means that while they can still equip it, cosmetically the animations won’t line up. Fortunately, the Viera have over 30 armor sets to choose from. More armor options are also planned.\n[*] [h2]Do you plan to support vanilla gear through mods like Armor Adapt?[/h2]\nI absolutely plan to support refitting vanilla gear with the assistance of Armor Adapt. This will further remedy the above.\n[*] [h2] My old character’s ship is affected, halp![/h2]\nExisting characters will need to take a few steps to refresh to the new ship. Follow these steps here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/732276079/595142777455563406/] Ship Fix [/url]\n[*] [h2]The Viera village I encountered might be missing a part[/h2]\nThere are a few minor issues with end parts of the tree canopy sometimes refusing to spawn. There is also a slight chance that no trees will spawn, making it difficult to reach the lower levels of villages. We’re working out a fix for this!\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://ko-fi.com/amazonvalkyrie] [img]https://i.imgur.com/k9HzoE6.jpeg [/img] [/url]\n[h1] If you’d like to show support for my work, feel free to consider donating!
