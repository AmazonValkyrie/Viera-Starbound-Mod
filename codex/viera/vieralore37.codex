    "^yellow;Sins of Yore^reset;\n\nSeeking redemption from her war-like past, Seonha journeyed on pilgrimage to pay tribute to the ^blue;Heart Tree^reset;, in hopes of cleansing within the Wood's sacred embrace. Drawn by the echoes of Seonha's turmoil, our paths first crossed when I came upon the masterful Fencer. My home in the warren of ^yellow;Otidaia^reset; had just been overtaken by similar shades of corruption in the form of a great beast of shadow and void.",
	
	"After exchanging guarded words, our fates became intertwined when we were beset upon by another beast in the forest, manipulated by the same corruption that had taken my home; spreading within the canopy. Before I could cast a protection spell, the mighty warrior Seonha leapt into action, quickly subduing the foe.",
	
	"Though cunning, she was, I could sense the weight of her spirit. I knew we both needed to seek answers, so I offered to journey with her to the sacred Heart Tree. Perhaps the sacred glade of the Wood will give us insight on the root of this corruption."
