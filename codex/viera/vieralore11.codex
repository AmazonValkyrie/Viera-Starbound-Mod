    "^yellow;Whispers of the Leaves^reset;\n\nWhen dusk descends and shadows stretch long, gather beneath the eldest tree. There, let your voice rise in harmony with the sigh of the evening breeze. The chant begins soft, a murmur among the leaves, growing with the wind until the forest itself sings with you.",

	"Thus is the bond renewed, the cycle kept, the spirit of the Wood preserved."
